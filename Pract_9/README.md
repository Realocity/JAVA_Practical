# JAVA-LABS

- Design a HTML form with two controls, viz, a text box and a button. The test box should take the name of the user. On clicking the button titled, “Greeting”, a welcome message saying, “ Hello <<name of the user>> ! Greeting of the day” should be displayed to the user. Write the necessary AWT/Swing program to handle this.
