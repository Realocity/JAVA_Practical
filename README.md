- 1. [Write a class MCAAdmission having methods getAdmission() and totalAdmissions(). Create multiple objects of MCAAdmissions class. On  invoking getAdmission() on the object the total no of students admitted to MCA should increase by one. Use totalAdmissions() to check how  many admissions are full.](https://github.com/Realocity/JAVA_Practical/tree/main/Pract_1)

- 2. [Create a package “InterfaceAbstractpkg”. In this package write an interface Area having methods compute() and print(). It also has a constant for Pi. This interface is used to compute area of given shape. Write Rectangle class and Circle class which implement this interface and override its methods. Write another class having objects of Rectangle class and Circle class and invoke their respective methods.package, Interface and abstract class.](https://github.com/Realocity/JAVA_Practical/tree/main/Pract_2)

- 3. [Write an interface Employee having methods viz, enroll(),terminate(),calculatePay(). Write classes ProductionDepartment, EngineeringDepartment to implement Employee interface and override its methods. enroll() method should take details from the employee and add him / her to the respective department and print a confirmatory message. terminate() should remove an employee from the department with a print statement. calculatePay() should print the total salary of the employee depending on his/her department and pay scale of that department. Create objects of these classes and invoke overridden methods on those objects.](https://github.com/Realocity/JAVA_Practical/tree/main/Pract_3)

- 4. [You are running a shared cab service. Write a class, BookARide. In this class write the method, bookSeat(int totalNoOfBooking).
In bookSeat() if totalNoOfBooking exceeds 4 throw RideOverBooked exception. Write your own user defined exception class, RideOverBooked.

- 9. [Design a HTML form with two controls, viz, a text box and a button. The test box should take the name of the user. On clicking the button titled, “Greeting”, a welcome message saying, “ Hello ((name of the user)) ! Greeting of the day” should be displayed to the user. Write the necessary AWT/Swing program to handle this.](https://github.com/Realocity/JAVA_Practical/tree/main/Pract_9)
