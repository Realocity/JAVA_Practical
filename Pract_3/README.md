# JAVA-LABS

- Write an interface Employee having methods viz, enroll(),terminate(),calculatePay(). Write classes ProductionDepartment, EngineeringDepartment to implement Employee interface and override its methods. enroll() method should take details from the employee and add him / her to the respective department and print a confirmatory message. terminate() should remove an employee from the department with a print statement. calculatePay() should print the total salary of the employee depending on his/her department and pay scale of that department. Create objects of these classes and invoke overridden methods on those objects.
